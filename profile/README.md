## About

In this organization you will find a little bit of everything, code that is worthwhile and a lot of code that will be half finished, hence the name, ramshackle code.

The logo, a claw from the arcade machines comes because we all, sooner or later, have had a boss that when a problem came into his mail, he would raise his head to see who he would assign it to... it reminded us of the Toy Story movie and the hook scene, we the little green dolls at the bottom of the machine and our boss up there handling the claw to see who he would choose.
